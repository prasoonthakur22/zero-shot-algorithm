# davinci-003-zero-shot-learning
the zero_shot_gpt3 function uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate a response to a given prompt. 
The function takes two arguments: prompt, which is the text prompt to be used for generating the response, and model, which is the specific GPT-3 model 
to use. The GPT-3 model is a neural network that has been trained on a large corpus of text, and it has learned to generate text that is similar in style
and content to the input text it has been trained on.

To generate a response to a given prompt, the zero_shot_gpt3 function sends a request to the GPT-3 API with the prompt and the specific GPT-3 model to 
use. The API returns a list of possible completions for the prompt, along with their probabilities. 
The function selects the highest probability completion and returns its text as the final response.

The docai function uses the zero_shot_gpt3 function to generate responses to user questions. The function prompts the user for a question, concatenates 
the question text with a specific prompt for the Caduceus app, and passes the resulting prompt to the zero_shot_gpt3 function. The zero_shot_gpt3 function
generates a response based on the prompt text and the specific GPT-3 model provided. The docai function prints the resulting response to the console.
